Allergies Be Gone
=================
An android app collects data on what an individual eats, does, how they feel(from Azure Face API) and if an allergic reaction occured in a certain day. And then it uses that data with previous allergic reaction symptoms to form a hypothesis with an indviduals present day picture to assist doctors with their diagnosis. This app was made mainly in TOHacks and makes use of Microsoft Azure Face API. Front-End by a-a7 and Back-End and Front-End integration by BilalShakh.
